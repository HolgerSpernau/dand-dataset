# Description
This is the second project within the DAND to go through the complete data analysis process from asking questions to a first evaluation of the data, data cleaning, the analysis of the data, the visualization of findings, drawing conclusions and giving a presentation. For this project I used the Jupyter notebook to document all these steps and finding.
